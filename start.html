                        We are creating a website that will provide UIC students with energy effieicent locations throughout the east campus.<br>
                        In order to strive for a cleaner community and a healthier planet, everyone must do their part.<br>
                        It begins with little steps in order to cause a greater impact.<br>
                        As you begin to build these little habits such as recycling and using clean energy, the change is iminent.<br>


                        This app will locate stations such as recycling bins, solar charging station, bike stations, and EV chargers
