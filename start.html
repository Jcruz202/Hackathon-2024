                        We are creating a website that will provide UIC students with energy effieicent
                        locations throughout the east campus. In order to strive for a cleaner community
                        and a healthier planet, everyone must do their part. It begins with little steps in order to cause a greater impact.
                        As you begin to build these little habits such as recycling and using clean energy, the change is iminent.
                        It is the commencement of a greener society where as a community we strive to improve our planet 
                        and give the future generation a better world to live ine This app will locate stations such as recycling bins,
                        solar charging station, bike stations, and EV chargers
